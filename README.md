# Java Pattern Project 🌟

Welcome to the **Java Pattern Project**! This is a beginner-friendly and fun Java project that showcases various pattern programs, including **Star Patterns**, **Number Patterns**, **Alphabet Patterns**, and even some **3D Patterns** — all organized using a **menu-driven approach** and interactive **JOptionPane dialogs** for user input.


## 🚀 Features

- 🔷 Star Patterns (e.g., pyramids, diamonds, triangles)
- 🔢 Number Patterns (e.g., sequences, pyramids, Pascal’s triangle)
- 🔤 Alphabet Patterns (e.g., letters in various shapes)
- 🧊 3D Pattern Simulations using characters
- 🧭 Menu-driven interface
- 💬 User input via `JOptionPane` (Graphical dialog boxes)

## 📷 Demo

*Coming Soon!* (You can add screenshots or a screen recording of your program in action here.)


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Swing (JOptionPane)**
- **OOP Concepts**
- **Loops (for, while)**
- **Conditionals (if-else, switch)**


## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me:

- Practice nested loops and logic building
- Understand graphical input/output using `JOptionPane`
- Improve my understanding of conditionals and loop structures
- Build menu-driven programs for better user interaction
